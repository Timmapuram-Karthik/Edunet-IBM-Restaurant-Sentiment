    "# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### This script performs sentiment analysis on a collection of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in text, specifically whether a review conveys a positive or negative sentiment about a restaurant experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Data Loading and Exploration: The script loads a dataset containing restaurant reviews from a TSV file.It checks for any missing values and provides a glimpse of the dataset's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: The text data in the reviews undergoes preprocessing to ensure consistency and remove irrelevant information. The text is converted to lowercase, tokenized into words, and stemmed to their root forms. Common stopwords are also removed to focus on meaningful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Extraction: To enable machine learning models to process text data, the preprocessed reviews are transformed into numerical features. This process, known as Count vectorization, assigns weights to words based on their importance within each review and across the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Selection and Evaluation: The script considers multiple machine learning models for sentiment analysis, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XG Boost and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).Each model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on another subset to measure its predictive ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Best Model Identification: During evaluation, the script identifies the best-performing model based on its accuracy in predicting sentiment. This helps determine which model is most effective for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluation Metrics and Insights: The script provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, which reflects the proportion of correctly predicted sentiments. Additionally, it generates a confusion matrix and a classification report to offer insights into model performance for positive and negative sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conclusion: Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews holds practical value for understanding customer opinions, improving restaurant services, and making informed business decisions. This script demonstrates the process of preprocessing text, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance in sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data, contributing to enhanced customer experiences and data-driven decision-making in the restaurant industry."
